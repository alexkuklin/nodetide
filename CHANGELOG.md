Progress notes kept between sessions. Newest first. Each entry says what changed, why, and what is
still open, so a new session can pick up without re-deriving context.

## 2026-10-25 (privacy) - eID notary: attest from a government signature without exposing it

### Added
- **`eidas_notary`**: the verification service validates a CAdES signature from the person's eID card and issues ordinary
  attestations; the certificate (with the personal number) goes to that one party. `POST /api/verify/eid/attest`.
  - **Notary statement** (`eidas/notary_statement.py`): canonical text naming the identity, the notary's identity hash, a chain head,
    a validity window and one `Claim:` line per claim to attest (max 5, `legal_name | birthdate | age_over_18`). The request is bound
    to it (`AuthAssertion` with the statement's sha256), so a leaked file is useless to another notary and the holder decides what is attested.
  - **`EidNotary`** (`verifiers/eid_notary.py`): checks signature, certificate chain (own trust anchors, revocation), freshness, then each
    claim against the certificate; refuses on mismatch; one attestation per listed claim with `evidence {source, qscd}`, no certificate,
    no number. Certificate is never stored or logged (a test checks the log).
  - **New claim types** `birthdate` (ISO date) and `age_over_18` (`true`), so a person can prove adulthood without a birth date. Birth date
    comes from the certificate's `dateOfBirth` attribute or a Bulgarian `PNOBG-` EGN (checksum verified, century by month offset).
- **Bridge**: `NODETIDE_OIDC_NOTARY_ISSUERS` (pin for the eID-derived claims, high assurance); scopes `birthdate` and `age_over_18`, released as
  standard `birthdate` / `age_over_18` plus `verified_claims` entries; `eidas_notary` counts as the `eidas` trust framework.
- **Wallet**: tick the claims to attest, get one statement, upload the signature (sent to the notary, never stored), keep attestations only.
  `nodetide eid sign-file` accepts notary statements and prints what it signs before the PIN prompt.
- **Test stack**: trust anchors and revocation settings moved from the node to the verifier; the node no longer mounts anchors or sees a
  certificate and pins the verifier for email, phone and notary claims. Smoke test (synthetic CA, EGN-bearing certificate) passes: only listed
  claims attested, nothing personal in attestations or logs, bridge releases the verified name, birth date and age stay unreleased unless asked.
  441 tests.

### Planned (written down in `identity-system.md`, not testable yet)
- EU Digital Identity Wallet credentials (PID) with SD-JWT VC / mdoc selective disclosure over OpenID4VP as another method with the issuing
  state as trust anchor; depends on Bulgaria's wallet timing (unknown).
- Zero-knowledge proofs over a qualified signature (research).

### Open
- Real card + real Borica CA anchors still untried: needs the PIN and the CA certificates. The deployed server has no anchors, so its notary is off.
- The direct `eidas_qes` proof path (bridge sees the certificate) still exists as a library option but the stack no longer uses it.
- Birth date extraction covers Bulgarian EGN and the `dateOfBirth` attribute only.

## 2026-10-25 (verification) - SMS codes through a modem gateway

### Added
- **Phone verification** in the verification service (`sms_code`, assurance `low`, 6-digit codes, 10 minutes): the service
  queues the SMS (`verifiers/sms.py`, in memory, leased with retries) instead of sending it. `CodeVerifier` is now the shared
  base of `EmailVerifier` and `PhoneVerifier`; the API is generic over `/api/verify/{email|phone}/start|confirm` plus
  `GET .../{verification_id}/status` (queued | sent | failed + reason). Enabled by `NODETIDE_SMS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`;
  `NODETIDE_PHONE_ALLOWED` is the number mask (default `^\+359[0-9]{9}$`), rate limits 3/number, 3/identity, 10 total per hour.
- **Gateway endpoints**, bearer token (sha256-compared in constant time): `GET /api/gateway/sms/pending` (long poll, up to 30 s)
  and `POST /api/gateway/sms/{id}/result`. Chosen over a message broker: outbound-only HTTPS works behind NAT, nothing new to run.
- **`tools/sms-gateway/sms_gateway.py`**: the script for the home server with the USB modem (AT commands, text mode, pyserial).
  Modem-side safety: destination mask (default `+359` mobile), 10 per rolling 24 h (counted before the attempt, persisted in a
  0600 ledger with hashed numbers), 3 per number, ASCII-only text up to 160 characters, an id is never sent twice, expired
  messages are not sent, a wrong token stops it. `--dry-run [--dry-run-file]` and `--selftest-modem`. README with modem,
  ModemManager and systemd notes. 46 tests (`test_phone_verification`, `test_sms_gateway`) incl. a scripted fake serial port.
- Bridge: `NODETIDE_OIDC_PHONE_ISSUERS` (phone claims only); the test stack pins the verifier's issuer for email and phone.
  Wallet: add a phone claim, verify by SMS (shows queued / sent / refused). `init.sh` generates `SMS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
  (`--upgrade` adds it). Smoke test covers the SMS path via the gateway script in dry-run mode.

### Open
- Not tried with a real modem yet (nothing to test against here): the AT handling is tested against a scripted serial port only.
  Expect device-specific quirks (SIM PIN, `AT+CSCS`, message-sent timing); `--selftest-modem` is the first thing to run.
- The queue is in memory: a service restart drops pending SMS (the codes expire anyway).

## 2026-10-25 (trust) - email verification is an independent service

### Changed
- **No self-verification.** A node no longer runs a verifier (`NODETIDE_EMAIL_VERIFIER` and `create_app(email_verifier=)` are gone,
  as are `/api/verify/*` on nodes) and the OIDC bridge trusts no issuer it was not told about. Email attestations are accepted
  only from identity hashes in the new `NODETIDE_OIDC_EMAIL_ISSUERS` (email only; `TRUSTED_ISSUERS` still covers all types).
- **`nodetide.verifiers.service`**: the verifier as a standalone aiohttp service (`python -m nodetide.verifiers.service`) with
  its own database, its own issuer identity, its own public address (the audience of key-control proofs), `/health`,
  `/api/auth/challenge`, `/api/verify/issuer` (now includes the issuer's sigchain) and `/api/verify/email/start|confirm`.
  `NODETIDE_VERIFIER_PUBLISH_ISSUER` writes the issuer hash for the operator to pin.
- **Wallet**: starts the verification at the service, then asks the person for the emailed code (it no longer reads a mailbox,
  so no ssh tunnel); stores the issuer's chain and sends it with the presentation (`issuer_sigchain`), so the bridge needs no lookup.
- **Test stack**: new `verifier` container (`nt-verifier.<domain>`, port 4575); its issuer hash goes through a shared volume
  into the node's entrypoint; SMTP settings in `.env` send real mail (default: catch-all mailpit). `init.sh --upgrade` adds
  the new settings. `local-wallet.sh --tunnel` is replaced by `--verifier`. Smoke test plays the person (reads the code from
  mailpit) and checks the attestation is signed by the service identity; passes locally.

### Open
- Old attestations made by the node's former embedded issuer are no longer trusted: verify email again in the wallet.
- Attestations are not yet revocable through the service API (the issuer can sign revocations; no endpoint).

## 2026-10-25 (sign-in) - "Open in wallet" links for web wallets

### Added
- `NODETIDE_OIDC_WALLET_URLS` (comma separated http(s) addresses): the sign-in page shows an "Open in wallet at <host>" link
  per wallet, pointing at `<wallet>/signin?link=<challenge address>` (never the fragment secret). The test stack sets it to its
  own wallet plus `http://localhost:4572`, so a wallet running on the user's machine (`local-wallet.sh`) works. The existing
  "Open Nodetide app" deep link (`nodetide://`) still only works where the native app is installed.
- Test wallet: `GET /signin?link=...` previews the request (approval stays a POST).

## 2026-10-25 (deployment) - Grafana as a guinea pig + local wallet

### Added
- **Grafana** (`nt-grafana.<domain>`, port 4574) in the test stack: stock Grafana with its generic OAuth provider
  (PKCE, client secret, userinfo), registered as client `grafana`. Login = identity hash, email = verified email or
  `<hash>@nodetide.invalid`, role Viewer; the local admin account stays. Verified end to end locally with the wallet.
- `init.sh --upgrade` adds the new settings (hosts, client secret, admin password) to an existing `.env` without
  touching existing secrets and rewrites `config/clients.json`; the workflow runs it before every deploy.
- Open design point discussed: sign-in works without the user's own node because the wallet submits its sigchain with the
  assertion; a bridge must be up though (an application trusts one issuer). Not yet tested with separate bridge/home nodes.

## 2026-10-25 (infrastructure) - Terraform for Hetzner + manual workflow

### Added
- **`deploy/test/terraform/`**: one Hetzner Cloud server (cloud-init installs Docker, creates the `deploy` user, key-only
  ssh), firewall (22/80/443/icmp), ssh key, optional A/AAAA records via `hcloud_zone_rrset`. Remote state in the
  existing AWS S3 bucket `nodetide-terraform-state` (shared with distriblog-infra, key `nodetide-test/terraform.tfstate`). Provider lock file includes linux/darwin hashes.
- **Availability-aware placement** (`modules/placement`, pure module with 10 offline `terraform test` cases): picks the
  first usable (server type, location) from preference lists using `hcloud_server_types[].locations[].available` /
  deprecation; fails with a per-pair table when nothing is available. The `hcloud_datacenters` data source was NOT used:
  it is deprecated and the API returns 410 after 2026-10-01.
- **`.github/workflows/test-stack.yml`**: manual `plan | apply | destroy` (+ optional `deploy_app`, per-run type/location
  overrides), `test-stack` environment for approvals, concurrency lock, ssh wait for cloud-init, reuses the server's
  existing `.env` so redeploys keep secrets and data. Required secrets/variables and `gh` commands: `deploy/test/terraform/README.md`.

### Also
- `deploy/test/local-wallet.sh`: run the test wallet on your own machine against a remote node (keys stay local;
  optional ssh tunnel to the test mailbox). `wallet/app.py` honours `HOST`.

### Open
- Applied once to a real account (cpx22@fsn1, cx23 was sold out everywhere); stack serves valid certificates.
- Workflow untested on GitHub (needs the secrets above and the `test-stack` environment).
- Domain / who serves 80 and 443 on the target is still undecided.

## 2026-10-25 (deployment) - docker-compose test stack

### Added
- **`deploy/test/`**: a compose stack for testing on a server: `node` (OIDC bridge, email verifier, eID proof
  verifier, explorer), `mailpit` (catches verification emails), `rp` (**oauth2-proxy**, a standard OIDC client,
  in front of a page that prints the claims it receives), `wallet` (a test stand-in for the Nodetide app: identity,
  claims, email verification through the test mailbox, statement signing, sign-in approval) and an optional Caddy
  `edge`. Self-contained image built from the repo (no ECR/base image). `init.sh` writes `.env` and
  `config/clients.json` with random secrets, `deploy.sh` copies + builds + starts over ssh, `smoke.py` plays a
  browser through the whole sign-in. See `deploy/test/README.md`.
- **Validated locally with Docker**: `smoke.py run` passes against the stack, including oauth2-proxy completing OIDC
  discovery, PKCE, confidential-client auth and RS256 id_token verification against the bridge, verified email and
  (synthetic CA) legal name released, nothing released when the wallet shares nothing, and the explorer not
  showing the email address.
- `nodetide eid sign-file STATEMENT` signs a canonical claim statement made elsewhere (the wallet) with the card;
  refuses anything that is not a Nodetide claim statement. `nodetide eid anchors` now also accepts a bare `.p7s`.
  Testkit: `sign-file`, `anchors [FILE] --out DIR`.
- `NODETIDE_OIDC_ALLOW_INSECURE=1` accepts http issuer / redirect URIs (local testing only).
- Root `.dockerignore` (keeps secrets and the testkit out of the build context).

### Fixed
- `golang/go.sum` was never committed, so the Go Docker build (and CI) failed with "missing go.sum entry";
  added it and dropped the unused `x/crypto` requirement.

### Findings about CI (not changed)
- "Build and Push Docker Images" failed on the last push for two reasons unrelated to the new code: the Python build
  could not find `nodetide:python-base-latest` in ECR (the base image workflow rebuilt it concurrently and has now
  succeeded, so a re-run should pass) and the Go build lacked `go.sum` (fixed above). The deploy jobs were
  skipped, so production was not touched.

### Not yet done
- **Not deployed to a server**: needs a target (ssh access, domain names, who serves ports 80/443).
- The real-card path through the stack (wallet statement -> `sign-file` -> upload) has been run only with the
  synthetic CA; the wallet's multipart upload form is untested with a browser.

## 2026-10-25 (latest) - signing testkit

### Added
- **`testkit/`** (scope deliberately limited to signing): `./testkit/run setup | selftest | token |
  claim | sign | anchors | verify | report | clean`. Isolated state in `.testkit/` via the new
  `NODETIDE_HOME` variable (the CLI's data directory), so `~/.nodetide` is never touched. `report` prints
  only technical facts (no names, ID numbers or hashes) and is the thing to paste when asking for help.
  The kit is itself tested (`python/tests/test_testkit.py`).
- `nodetide eid anchors ATTESTATION --out DIR` (`eidas/anchors.py`): follows the certificate's
  AIA links to collect the issuer chain, checks each certificate signed the one below, shows
  SHA-256 fingerprints and saves them as trust anchors only after interactive confirmation. Refuses
  private/loopback addresses unless `--allow-private`.

### Fixed
- Claim IDs could begin with `-`, so `nodetide claim ...` / `eid ...` parsed them as options. New
  claim IDs always start with a letter or digit.

### Scope note
- A broader testkit (demo node, simulated user app, simulated OIDC client, Go/UI runners) was started and
  removed at the owner's request: "only signing". If wanted later, the useful missing piece is a
  simulated user app, since no real client can yet approve OIDC sign-ins or verify an email claim.

## 2026-10-25 (later) - eID token tooling, name mapping, verified claims in OIDC

### Added
- **OIDC bridge releases verified claims** (`core/relying_party.py`, `oidc/provider.py`): scopes
  `profile`/`email`/`phone` map to `legal_name`/`email`/`phone` claims; the user's app sends
  `presentations` with its assertion; the bridge applies `ClaimRule`s (issuers, proof types,
  assurance, age, no recovery since) and returns standard claims plus an OpenID Connect for Identity
  Assurance `verified_claims` block. `display.claims_requested` in the challenge tells the app what
  is acceptable. Self-asserted genesis names are now labelled `name_verified: false`.
  Config: `NODETIDE_OIDC_TRUSTED_ISSUERS`, `NODETIDE_OIDC_NAME_MATCH`.
- **eID signing with PIN, rewritten against the real card** (`eidas/pkcs11.py`, `cli/claims.py`):
  slots and certificates are read without any PIN (`nodetide eid tokens`); the signing slot is chosen
  explicitly; the PIN is typed at a hidden prompt, tried once, never stored; locked / final-try /
  count-low states are checked first; keys that demand the PIN for every signature
  (`CKA_ALWAYS_AUTHENTICATE`) are handled with a context-specific login.
- **Certificate name mapping** (`eidas/certs.py`): givenName/surname plus the common name minus the
  surname (middle names, patronymics), and match strengths `exact` < `transliterated` <
  `approximate` (Alexey/Aleksey, Cyrillic vs Latin). `POST /api/claims/verify` takes `name_match`.

### Findings about the real token (no personal data)
- B-Trust (BORICA) card, Gemalto IDPrime MD, RSA 3072, SafeNet client libraries in `/usr/local/lib`
  (`libIDPrimePKCS11.dylib` is the default module). Certificate: qualified, QSCD, key usage
  content commitment, issued by "B-Trust Operational Qualified CA", subject has givenName, surname,
  serialNumber (national ID, never copied), CN with patronymic, and an email address.
- Two slots with separate PINs: slot 0 (authentication; certificate and public key visible, private
  key hidden before login) and slot 16 "(Digital Signature)". The qualified signing key is expected
  behind slot 16's PIN. Wrong PINs cost retries: nothing in the tool retries.
- The certificate carries an email address; verifying an `email` claim from it is possible later but
  qualified CAs do not necessarily prove mailbox control.

### Not yet done
- **Real signing has not been run**: needs the user's PIN. Expected: `eid tokens`, create a
  `legal_name` claim, `eid sign CLAIM_ID --slot 16`, `eid chain`, `eid verify --anchors DIR`
  with the B-Trust CA certificates from the provider.

## 2026-10-25 - Claims, attestations, OIDC bridge, explorer, native SSO

### Added
- **Native SSO** (`core/auth.py`, `api/auth/native.py`, `golang/auth/`): challenge/response login
  with `AuthRequest`/`AuthAssertion`, `authenticate` device capability, audience- and
  nonce-bound, domain-separated signatures. Python endpoints `/api/auth/{challenge,verify,login}`;
  the Go node has `challenge` and `verify` (sigchain must be supplied; no identity store yet).
  Python and Go agree byte-for-byte on canonical JSON and sigchain hashing (checked by a
  cross-language run, including claim events).
- **OIDC bridge** (`oidc/`): any Nodetide identity can sign in to standard OIDC apps
  (code flow + PKCE, RS256 id_token, `sub` = identity hash). Unknown or stale identities are queued
  in a persistent fetcher (`oidc/fetcher.py`, SSRF-guarded) and the user sees "failed for now".
  Enable with `NODETIDE_OIDC_ISSUER`; see README.
- **Explorer** (`explorer/`, `web/explorer/`): read-only API (`/api/explorer/*`) and a
  dependency-free UI at `/explorer` (`?node=` browses another node). Search index tables are kept
  up to date by `Storage.save_sigchain`; existing DBs are backfilled on open. `NODETIDE_EXPLORER=0`
  disables it.
- **Claims and attestations** replace `IdentityAssertion` (see spec section "Claims and
  Attestations"):
  - Sigchain events `ADD_CLAIM` / `REVOKE_CLAIM` (master or device with `manage_claims`), strict
    rules in `Sigchain.verify` and mirrored in Go (`golang/auth/sigchain.go`).
  - `core/claims.py`: salted commitments, value normalization, `ClaimDocument`, `Attestation`,
    `AttestationRevocation`, verification. Pinned commitment test vectors.
  - API `api/claims.py`: claims listing, signed publish/unpublish of claim documents,
    attestations, revocations, stateless `POST /api/claims/verify`.
  - **Email verification** (`verifiers/`): node-owned issuer identity (device key with
    `sign_identity`), SMTP / dev-log / memory mail senders, rate limits, single-use codes.
  - **eIDAS qualified e-signature proofs** (`eidas/`): CAdES-BES build/parse, QCStatements,
    certificate path validation (two-phase so strangers' certificates cannot make the node fetch
    URLs), Bulgarian name transliteration, PKCS#11 signer. Proof attestations are never stored or
    published because the embedded certificate carries personal identifiers.
  - CLI: `nodetide claim add|list|revoke|export`, `nodetide eid statement|attach|sign|tokens|chain|verify`.
- Trust delegations gained a claim-type `scope`; `GET /api/trust/calculate/{hash}?claim_type=`
  now computes path trust to an attestation issuer.

### Removed
- `IdentityAssertion`, `trust_assertions` table (dropped on open), `/api/trust/assertions`,
  `nodetide trust assert`, the web client's assertion UI. No migration: nothing was in use.

### Fixed
- `/api/auth/token` (legacy) called `Sigchain.from_events`, which does not exist.

### Verification at time of writing
- Python: full suite passes (`PYTHONPATH=src:. pytest tests`).
- Go: `gofmt`, `go vet`, `go test ./auth/` pass; cross-language run against the live Go server passes.
- Explorer UI exercised in jsdom against a seeded live node (no browser errors).
- **Not tested on real hardware or real credentials:** the PKCS#11 signer (only against a fake
  token), real Bulgarian eID certificates and trust anchors, real SMTP delivery.

### Open / next
- Try the real eID token: `nodetide eid tokens` then `eid sign`, or `eid statement` + the provider's
  signing app + `eid attach`; then `eid chain` / `eid verify` with the provider's CA certificates.
  Tokens whose key needs the PIN for every signature (`CKA_ALWAYS_AUTHENTICATE`) are not handled yet.
- No client UI yet (web, Android) for claims, signing assertions, or answering OIDC sign-ins; the
  OIDC bridge and email verifier are only exercised through the API and tests.
- OIDC bridge does not yet put verified claims (`name`, `email`) into id_tokens.
- Relying-party policy evaluation (`evaluate claim` in the spec) is described but only the pieces
  (`verify_attestation`, `/api/claims/verify`, trust path calculation) exist.
- The Go node has no identity store, sessions, OIDC bridge or explorer API.
- Python's `Sigchain.verify` accepts `social_recovery` without checking the trustee threshold (old
  TODO); Go rejects such chains.
- Sessions, challenges, OIDC attempts and pending email codes are in memory: run a single instance.
- Trusted-list handling for eIDAS is manual (operator supplies CA certificates); no CAdES-T
  timestamp checking, so proof attestations are kept short-lived.
- `golang/` has no `go.sum`; the Dockerfile resolves modules at build time.

### Working notes for the next session
- Tests: create a venv with the project dependencies plus `pytest pytest-asyncio`, then
  `cd python && PYTHONPATH=src:. pytest tests`. Go: `cd golang && go test ./auth/`.
- Tests that need PKI use the synthetic CA in `python/tests/pki.py`; never commit real certificates
  or signature files (they contain national ID numbers).
- Editing tools in this environment decoded `\uXXXX` escape sequences written in files; build such
  strings from a placeholder instead (see the canonical-JSON golden tests).
