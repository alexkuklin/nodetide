# Nodetide test stack

A docker-compose deployment for testing the whole thing on a server, with a real, independent
OIDC client in front of it. Nothing here is production: the wallet holds a development identity
in plain JSON and the mailbox is a catch-all.

```
browser ──► rp (oauth2-proxy) ──► "Signed in" page (shows the claims it received)
   │            │ standard OIDC: discovery, PKCE, client secret, RS256 id_token
   │            ▼
   ├──────► node (Nodetide: OIDC bridge, eID proof verifier, explorer; verifies nobody itself)
   │
   ├──────► verifier (independent email verification service, own issuer identity)
   │            │ one-time codes by SMTP
   │            ▼
   │         mailpit (catch-all: the codes land here unless SMTP_HOST is set in .env)
   └──────► wallet (stands in for the Nodetide app: identity, claims, signs-in on your behalf)
```

| Service | What it is | Public name | Local port |
|---|---|---|---|
| `node` | the Python node from this repo | `nt-node.<domain>` | 4570 |
| `rp` | oauth2-proxy + a page that prints the received claims | `nt-rp.<domain>` | 4571 |
| `wallet` | test wallet (HTTP basic auth, user `wallet`) | `nt-wallet.<domain>` | 4572 |
| `grafana` | Grafana with native OIDC: an ordinary third-party app as the guinea pig | `nt-grafana.<domain>` | 4574 |
| `verifier` | independent email verification service: own storage, own issuer identity | `nt-verifier.<domain>` | 4575 |
| `mailpit` | catch-all mailbox for the verifier's mail (private; SSH tunnel to read it) | - | 4573 |
| `edge` | optional Caddy with automatic HTTPS | all five | 80 / 443 |

Everything binds to `127.0.0.1`. The browser and the containers use the very same public URLs
(the containers reach them through `host-gateway`), so what works here is what a real client sees.

## Try it on your machine first

```sh
cd deploy/test
./init.sh --local                 # .env + config/, URLs under *.localtest.me:8080 (plain http)
docker compose up -d --build      # the edge profile is on in local mode
python3 smoke.py run              # needs the repo's Python env (nodetide, aiohttp)
```

Then open `http://nt-rp.localtest.me:8080`: you are sent to the Nodetide sign-in page. Open the wallet at
`http://nt-wallet.localtest.me:8080` (password: `WALLET_PASSWORD` in `.env`), paste the sign-in address,
choose which claims to reveal, approve, and the first tab shows what the application received.

`smoke.py prepare` makes a synthetic "eID" CA so the legal-name path runs without a card. It edits `.env`;
undo that (remove `ANCHORS_DIR` and `EIDAS_REVOCATION` lines) before real use. `deploy.sh` refuses to ship it.

## Deploy to a server

The server needs Docker with the compose plugin, three DNS names pointing at it, and either free ports
80/443 (use `--edge`) or an existing reverse proxy (see `nginx.conf.example`; the stack only listens locally).

```sh
./init.sh --domain example.org --edge      # drop --edge if nginx or similar already serves 80/443
./deploy.sh user@server                    # copies the sources, builds and starts on the server
./deploy.sh user@server --dry-run          # show what would be copied
./deploy.sh user@server --down             # stop (volumes are kept)
```

It builds on the server from the copied sources, so no registry or CI is involved. The mailbox is private:
`ssh -L 4573:127.0.0.1:4573 user@server` and open `http://localhost:4573`.

## Testing with your real eID card

The card stays on your machine; the server only ever sees signatures and certificates.

1. In the wallet, add a **legal name** claim (the names as on your certificate) and press **Create statement
   to sign**; download `statement-….txt`. You have 10 minutes to sign it.
2. On your machine: `./testkit/run sign-file ~/Downloads/statement-….txt` (asks for the digital-signature PIN;
   see `testkit/README.md` for the slots and PIN safety). It writes `statement-….txt.p7s`.
3. The server must trust your CA. Fetch it, check the fingerprints against the provider's published ones,
   and put it where the stack reads anchors:
   `./testkit/run anchors statement-….txt.p7s --out deploy/test/anchors` and
   `./deploy.sh user@server` (the node picks the anchors up on restart).
4. Upload the `.p7s` in the wallet. The node's verdict is shown next to the attestation. Revocation is checked
   online (`EIDAS_REVOCATION=hard-fail` in `.env`; use `soft-fail` while debugging a provider's OCSP).
5. Open the application at `nt-rp.<domain>` and approve the sign-in in the wallet with the legal name shared.
   The page lists `name_verified: true` and a `verified_claims` block naming the `eidas` trust framework.

The certificate inside the signature holds your national ID number. It travels to the server inside the wallet's
attestation and to nowhere else, and the node never stores it (proof attestations are not persisted); but the
wallet's volume does keep the attestation file, so `docker compose down -v` when you are done.

## Files

| | |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh` | the stack and its self-contained image |
| `init.sh` | writes `.env` (random secrets) and `config/clients.json` |
| `deploy.sh` | copy + build + start on a server over ssh |
| `smoke.py` | end-to-end check, plays a browser through the standard OIDC client |
| `wallet/`, `echo/` | the test wallet and the page that prints received claims |
| `Caddyfile`, `nginx.conf.example` | TLS / routing for the three names |
| `anchors/` | CA certificates (PEM/DER) the node trusts for eID proofs; empty = proofs switched off |

## Security notes

- `.env`, `config/`, `anchors/` and `.smoke/` are git-ignored and excluded from the Docker build context.
- The wallet's keys are development keys; its password is the only thing between the internet and that identity.
- `NODETIDE_OIDC_ALLOW_INSECURE` (plain http) exists only for the local profile and is `0` for a domain.

## Server on Hetzner

`terraform/` creates the server (checking real availability) and `.github/workflows/test-stack.yml` applies it manually; see `terraform/README.md` for the required secrets.

## Wallet on your own machine

The wallet only makes outbound HTTPS calls to the node, so it can run locally and keep its keys on your machine
instead of on the server:

```sh
./local-wallet.sh https://nt-node.<domain>   # then open http://localhost:4572
```

It talks to the verification service at `nt-verifier.<domain>` (override with `--verifier URL`). State is in
`.local-wallet/` (git-ignored); the password is generated once and printed. Use the local wallet's identity for
sign-ins instead of the one on the server (the server's wallet service can simply stay unused).

## Grafana as a guinea pig

`nt-grafana.<domain>` is stock Grafana configured with its generic OAuth provider, the way any real application
would be: discovery URLs, PKCE, a client secret. Press **Sign in with Nodetide**, approve in the wallet and you land
in Grafana as a Viewer whose login is your identity hash (the email is the verified one if you shared it, otherwise a
placeholder `@nodetide.invalid`). The local `admin` account (password `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`) stays
available so you cannot lock yourself out. On an existing server run `./init.sh --upgrade` once; it adds the
Grafana settings and keeps every existing secret. The workflow does that automatically.

## Email verification is a separate service

The `verifier` container is a party of its own: its own process, database and issuer identity, nothing shared with
the node except one public value. It emails a one-time code; **you read the email and type the code into the wallet**
(the wallet never reads a mailbox). The node trusts no issuer by default: the verifier writes its identity hash to a
shared file and the node's entrypoint pins it as `NODETIDE_OIDC_EMAIL_ISSUERS`, for email claims only.

- By default the mail goes to the catch-all `mailpit`, readable with `ssh -L 4573:127.0.0.1:4573 <server>` and
  http://localhost:4573.
- To receive real mail set `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURITY` (starttls|ssl|none), `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` and
  `EMAIL_FROM` in `.env` on the server, then `docker compose up -d verifier`.

## SMS codes (phone claims)

The verification service also verifies **phone** claims: it queues an SMS and a gateway script with a USB modem
(`tools/sms-gateway/`, runs anywhere, only outbound HTTPS) fetches and sends it. `init.sh` generates
`SMS_GATEWAY_TOKEN` in `.env` (an existing server gets it from `init.sh --upgrade`); the same value goes to the gateway.
Numbers must match `PHONE_ALLOWED` (default `^\+359[0-9]{9}$`), and the gateway enforces its own mask and a count limit
(10 per 24 h by default). The wallet shows whether the SMS is queued, sent or was refused. Without a gateway the
messages stay queued and expire. `python3 smoke.py run` exercises the whole path with the gateway script in dry-run mode.

## eID: the verification service as notary

Legal name, birth date and "over 18" are proven from your eID card by the verification service acting as a notary; the
node and the applications never see your certificate or personal number.

1. In the wallet add the claims you want (legal name, birth date, "I am over 18"), tick the ones to attest and press
   *Create the statement to sign*. The statement names the notary and lists only what you ticked.
2. Sign it with the card on your machine: `nodetide eid sign-file notary-statement.txt` (shows the statement, asks the PIN).
3. Upload the `.p7s` in the wallet. It goes to the notary only and is not kept; the wallet keeps the attestations, which
   contain no certificate and nothing about the claims you left out.

### Trust anchors: published links, not copies

The CA certificates the notary trusts are **not in the repository**. `trust-anchors.json` is the published list of links to
where each provider publishes its certificates, each with the SHA-256 fingerprint it must have:

| CA | Published at | Pinned SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| B-Trust Operational Qualified CA (BORICA AD, Bulgaria; valid to 2033-05-31) | https://ca.b-trust.org/repository/B-TrustOperationalQCA_DER.crt (listed on https://www.b-trust.bg/en/queries/certification-chains-installation) | `499a9ca8b47ee84437f90b96fb40413ea293f9b3942a160837a0c67b0ec5ba0c` |

`./fetch-anchors.py` (stdlib only) downloads each link into `anchors/`, **refuses anything that does not match the pin**, and
cross-checks every run against the country's EU trusted list (https://crc.bg/files/_en/TSL_BG.xml, found through the EU list
of trusted lists at https://ec.europa.eu/tools/lotl/eu-lotl.xml): with `--strict` (the deploy workflow uses it) it stops if a
pinned certificate is not a *granted qualified-certificate service* there any more. The trusted list names the qualified CA
itself, not its root, so that intermediate is the anchor. The workflow runs it before every deploy and the verifier is
recreated when the set changes. To trust another provider add an entry (link + fingerprint you checked) and open a pull request.

How the pin was verified: downloaded from BORICA's repository over HTTPS, fingerprint computed locally, and found in the
Bulgarian trusted list as service *B-Trust Operational Qualified CA*, type QC, status granted. The list's XML signature is not
verified by the script (see the open point in `identity-system.md`), which is why the pin, not the list, is what is trusted.

`python3 smoke.py prepare` still makes a synthetic CA and points the verifier at it for the local test; `python3 smoke.py run`
covers the whole path, including that an unlisted birth date gets no attestation. Never deploy a `.env` that trusts it.
